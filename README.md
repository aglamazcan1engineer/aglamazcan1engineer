Junior Mobile App Developer | Python | Flutter | Web Development | AI Enthusiast | Self-Taught Programmer

Passionate self-taught programmer with a decade-long journey in software development. At 21, I've already created 'BeautiFi', an innovative social media app integrating AI, and 'VideoCreator', an AI-powered YouTube video generator (both available on my GitHub).

My coding adventure began at 11, fueled by curiosity and determination. Despite studying Civil Engineering at Çukurova University, my true passion lies in software development, machine learning, and AI.
From Kızıltepe Science High School to Mardin Anatolian High School, I've always sought challenges that push my boundaries. Now, I'm on a mission to revolutionize the tech world with cutting-edge solutions.
Constantly learning and adapting to the latest trends in AI and software development. Ready to bring fresh perspectives and innovative ideas to your team. Let's connect and create something extraordinary!
